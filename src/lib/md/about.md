# Introduction

I'm a undergrad computer science student in my final year. I was always curious about technologies. I got introduced to programming at age of 14. At that time I would play games and a lot of the games would be repacked with a nice looking installer and crazy compression. That really fascinated me. And so I wanted to make my own repacks. I got into <a href="https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php" target="_blank">Inno Setup</a> which is a tool to create installers with it's own language.

# My journey

I wasn't super into academics but my love for computers made me study hard so that I could get into a computer science programme in a good university.

## Competitive Programming

In my first 2 years of university, most of my free time went into problem solving in various sites like codeforces, codechef and doing contests. I learned the inner workings of different data structures that a lot of programmers take for granted. I also went over a ton of well known algorithms that is used extensively in the real world, specially the graph problems which is still my favourite.

## Linux

When the pandemic started I left my desktop in my university dorm and I was left with a old laptop with 2GB ram. It just couldn't handle windows. That's when I found linux. At first, I didn't tinker much and just did problem solving with the sublime text editor. After a while I discovered the terminal and the power to do just about anything in a linux environment. I got into window managers and obsessed over customizing my environment to exactly what I wanted, which is a keyboard driven workflow and a minimal, fast system. Naturally, I discovered vim and followed through the same obsession.

## Capture The Flag

In my 3rd year, I discovered CTF. Its a competition where you have to analyze or exploit some vulnerabilities to find a hidden information which we call a flag. My experience with linux gave me a big boost and I started to compete immediately.

## Development

I primarily coded in C++ in my first 2 years which really shaped my mindset and enabled me to grasp any other language afterwords. My first projects were games written in C++. After a while I wanted to make a web app and learned about express, react and a ton about authentication mechanisms. Although I don't like javascript that much, being able to build apps and deploy it on the web where everyone can use it made it worthwhile.
